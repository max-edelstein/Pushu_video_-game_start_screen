# Pushu_video_-game_start_screen
This example is the source code to my start screen for my video game "Pushu".
I learned how to set the colours of the background from Shen Mansell (shenmansell@hotmail.com)  
bung example. This example shows how colors can be set on a background map.
Note how the P in "Pushu" should be blue but it is yellow. I did this on purpose.
Also see how the map in vram data that is offscreen is tiled blue P's. This is because the first tile by default
will cover all non initialized tile area.  Soon I will post and create a guide to using GBTD and GBMB. 
I experimented and learned from these examples to create
my start and end screens for my small video game "Pushu". I hope these examples can help you. 
I attempted to document them to the best of my knowledge, but I am not a pro.
Some school in 2008 made a video series explaining how to use
GBMB and GBTD to create tiles and maps, but the videos were lost.
